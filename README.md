## Why Accessibility is Important?

**Accessibility** means that all people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with electronic information and be active, contributing members of the digital world.

Visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities should be taken into account when implementing accessibility measures.
